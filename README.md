# svdmi


This Python script contains several common pre-processing in NLP such as PPMI computation, SVD-based dimensionality reduction, and PLSR-based distribution prediction.

## Dependencies

The following packages are required.

* Python 2.7 (not tested with Python 3)
* [numpy]([http://www.numpy.org/) 
* [scipy](http://scipy.org/) 
* [sparsesvd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sparsesvd/) 
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 
* [svmlight-loader](https://github.com/mblondel/svmlight-loader)

## Installation

There is no specific installation for svdmi. Once you have all the dependencies installed, you can run svmi as described in the usage section.

## Usage


### PPMI
  Positive Pointwise Mutual Information

### SVD
  Singular Value Decomposition-based dimensionality reduction (SVD1) and matrix smoothing (SVD2).

### PLSR
  Partial Least Square Regression-based distribution prediction.
